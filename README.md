This is a capstone project for the University of San Diego Applied Data Science Masters Program. 

**-- Project Status: Completed**

## Installation
The following commands will help you clone the project onto your machine:

git init

git clone https://github.com/CalebMcCurdy/Political_Bias_Topic_Analysis.git

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to investigate the effects of various independent variables on apartment rental prices in Los Angeles, California. The scope is narrowed to 1-bed, 1-bath apartments only. The area is narrowed to "West LA," in and around Santa Monica. I perform regression analysis with a focus on access to food availability (proximity to various tiers of grocery stores).
